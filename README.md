# Features Not implemented at this stage

## Gym User Nutrition Story

As a gym member, I want to view my daily meals and see how they align with my fitness goals (e.g., muscle gain, fat loss, maintenance). Make proper decisions regarding my food diet to improve my performance and results in the gym.

## Gym Nutritionist Story

As a gym nutritionist, I want to view my clients daily meals and see how they align with their fitness program. Create and assign meal plans to individual clients that includes calories, meal timing and varieties. View client meal profiles such as goals, preferences and allergies. Send client reports about their nutrition activities.

## Gym Instructor Story

As a gym instructor member I want to view my class schedule so that I can manage my time. View who is registered for my classes so that I can prepare my classes accordingly. Update my program and specialties so that members know what I can offer. Track client progress so that I can provide better guidance. Send messages or updates to my clients to keep them engagged in the process

## Gym Admin Story

As an gym admin I want to manage membership plans and pricing so that I can adjust them as needed. View all bookings and cancellations so I can manage gym capacity. Add, remove instructors to keep the site up-to-date. Generate reports on user activities and revenus that we can track performance. Manage website content, offers and announcements easily.

## Gym User Payment Story

As a gym user I want to pay for my membership online so that I can save time. Update my update my payment method so that my membership renews automatically. View payment history and invoices so that I can track financial expenditure in the gym.

## Classes page

In this section the user will make a selection based on the week day and the table below will automatically update the display showing the classes available along side their instructors and timing. But this feature is left for future implementation because of the limitations of **[CSS/HTML]**. The user interaction requires higher technology such as javascript to be able to offer better human interaction with the system.

## Membership

This page will allow the user to show the different deals that available when joinning the feel good gym.
In the membership last section the user can make a selection on **[Happy Deal]** or **[Ulitimate Deal]**. The selection changes to orange color indicating the user made their choice of deals but at the moment nothing will happen which I left it to future development. The user interaction requires higher technology such as javascript to be able to offer better human interaction with the system.
